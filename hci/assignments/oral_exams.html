									<p>
										The <a href="../index.html#objectives">objectives</a> for the class center upon practical skills that will help you in understanding and executing a user-centered design process which we will apply throughout the semester. Written assignments and demos for group design sprints can shed insight on what you've learned. Oral exams will fill in one more piece of the puzzle in assessing how well you can apply what you've learned. Think of it like an interview. 
									</p>

									<p>
										We will have two oral exams throughout the semester: a midterm and a final. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E2OrMdiVcrzlpvOkWWVpFbJwJCacrLi3W5Exeagb2EI/edit?usp=sharing">Sign up for a time slot using this link</a>. In addition to that, the TAs and I will share demos in-class of a spectrum of responses to give you a sense of what to expect from a high-quality and low-quality response. You will also have the opportunity to practice in-class with your peers. 
									</p>

									<h3 id="format">Format</h2>

									<p>
										An oral exam will function like an interview. You will sign up for a time slot during the midterm and final exam periods during which you, me, and the TAs will meet. The oral exam will be a 5-10 minute conversation and will typically consist of 1-3 questions. This is your opportunity to demonstrate how you can apply the things you have learned throughout the semester, in a way not dissimilar from what you might be asked about in an interview for a job role as a UX designer or UX researcher. I may ask follow-up questions based on your responses. 
									</p>

									<hr class="minor" />


									<h3 id="grading">Grading</h2>

									<p>
										You will be graded on how well you are able to apply and articulate what you know using the <a href="../rubrics/oral_exam_rubric.pdf">oral exam rubric</a>.
									</p>

									<hr class="minor" />


									<h3 id="prep">Preparation</h2>

									<p>
										Each week, our course schedule will contain a set of content you are asked to consume. Often this will involve short readings, YouTube videos, podcasts, or slide decks. My goal is to transform the lecture section of the course into a design studio as much as possible (think of it as a hybrid "flipped" classroom. While there will be a lecture roughly once a week, talking through a million examples only gives you limited design capabilities. Iterating through, presenting, and critiquing each others’ designs is where you will really learn to build in a human-centered way.
									</p>
									<p>
										Weekly, you will be asked to fill out a short quiz based on that week’s content. The content may come from the readings or from the lecture. These are <i>optional</i> (as in, they will not affect your grade); however, you are encouraged to participate, as these questions will help you prepare for the types of things we might ask during the oral exams.<!--You <i>may not</i> use your notes. -->
									</p>

									<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>

									<p>
										Aside from internet sources, here are a few of the excellent books that we will be drawing from. If you want to dive deeper, they are all freely available to borrow as either physical books or ebooks from the Emory Library:
										<ul>
											<li><i>Designing with the Mind in Mind</i> by Jeff Johnson</li>
											<li><i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> by Don Norman</li>
											<li><i>Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective</i> by Scott MacKenzie</li>
											<li><i>Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design</i> by Bill Buxton</li>
										</ul>

									<h1>Airport Design</h1>

									<ul>
									  <li><strong>Group size:</strong> <span class="icon solid fa-user"></span> Individual</li>
									  <li><strong>DUE:</strong> Tuesday, January 25. 11:59 PM.</li>
									</ul>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
									<p>Before your first group design spring, this individual assignment will introduce you to some aspects of the design process:</p>

									<ol>
									  <li>Visual Design</li>
									  <li>Sketching for Ideation (using paper)</li>
									  <li>Evaluation (planning)</li>
									</ol>

									<p>Typically, a <em>critical</em> portion of the user-centered design process is getting feedback from real users. In the interest of time, you will only be getting preliminary feedback from classmates. However, you will be writing up a potential evaluation plan in your blog post.</p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3 id="designing-for-others">Choose Your Problem</h3>

									<p>In this assignment sprint, you will choose an existing aspect of the airport experience and redesign it to improve the user experience. This could include, e.g.:</p>

									<ul>
									  <li>Transportation to/from airport</li>
									  <li>Flight check-in experience</li>
									  <li>Requesting wheelchair assistant</li>
									  <li>Security</li>
									  <li>Purchasing refreshments in-flight</li>
									  <li>In-flight software for pilots</li>
									  <li>...</li>
									</ul>


									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3 id="information-design">Information Design</h3>

									<p>
										<em>Collect evidence along the way! Don’t shoot yourselves in the foot for your <a href="../design_docs.html">design reflection</a>!</em> Be sure to state your assumptions and document your process. Include ample photos and description of the current user experience. What are the potential pain points in the current experience? Who is the user that your design is intended for? How does your design improve upon that experience? This is intentionally somewhat open-ended to give you freedom to explore a problem and context of interest and get acquainted with the design process.
									</p>
									

									<p>Helpful Advice:</p>

									<ul>
									  <li><a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/9-information-design-tips-to-make-you-a-better-web-designer--psd-1601">9 Information Design Tips to Make You a Better Web Designer</a></li>
									  <li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-10-enduring/">“Top 10 Enduring Web-Design Mistakes”</a> posted by the Nielsen Norman Group</li>
									</ul>

									<p><strong>Output:</strong> Use sketching as a tool to explore your designs. The goal here is to rapidly explore <em>many</em> different solutions with messy sketches. After you have thoroughly explored the design space (you should have at least 10 ideas for each screen or aspect of the experience), use paper to construct a cleaner paper prototype.</p>

									<p><strong>You should test this paper prototype with other people in the class</strong>. While they don’t represent your users (so this is typically bad practice), I want you to get in the habit of getting feedback on whatever you create. We’ll discuss user testing more in a week or two. Until then, do your best to get worthwhile feedback and change your prototype accordingly.</p>

									<p><strong>Design a more complete evaluation plan</strong>. Assume time and resources were not a problem. How would you assess if your design accomplished the goals you set out to achieve? Write a few paragraphs describing how you might conduct an evaluation accordingly. Again, don't fret too much on this part. We will learn more formal techniques in the coming weeks, so use this opportunity to be creative with your evaluation design -- but be systematic!</p>

									<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
									<ul>
									  <li>The output from this assignment should be the <a href="../design_docs.html">design document</a>. Submit the link of each Medium post along with your name on Canvas. As with all design documents, it should include evidence of your design process. <strong>You do NOT need to create a demo video for this design module.</strong> For this assignment, I would expect a <em>minimum</em> of the following:
									    <ul>
									      <li>pictures of your various sketches</li>
									      <li>a cleaned up paper prototype (more broadly, the evolution of your design should be clear)</li>
									      <li>a description of how your incorporated feedback from your classmates</li>
									      <li>a description of a more complete evaluation plan</li>
									    </ul>
									  </li>
									</ul>

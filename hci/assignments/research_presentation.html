									<h1>Research Presentation (Grad Only)</h1>

									<ul>
									  <li><strong>Who:</strong> <span class="icon solid fa-user-graduate"></span> Grad students only</li>
									  <li><strong>Presentation Day:</strong> <em>variable</em>, sign up by Thursday, January 20 (by <a href="https://forms.gle/P3KC3iyqYByAhgtY8">completing the course survey</a>).</li>

									<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
									<p>
										What does research in HCI look like? For this assignment, you'll sign up for a short virtual presentation on a paper of your choice from an HCI-related venue such as <a href="https://chi2022.acm.org">CHI</a>, <a href="https://cscw.acm.org/">CSCW</a>, <a href="http://ieeevis.org">IEEE VIS</a>, <a href="https://iui.acm.org">IUI</a>, or <a href="https://ubicomp.org">UbiComp</a>.
									</p>

										<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lrhuThtfcct8YoIKJtGAr5BZG_xcL3YsNu1ezsmSeRA/edit?usp=sharing">View the schedule of presentations here</a>. The schedule will be populated based on balancing your preferences in the course survey you will complete on Day 1. <b>Note: You must get approval for your chosen paper -- see me after class or email me.</b>
									</p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3>The Basics</h3>
									<p>
										Create a slide deck to summarize a research paper in <b>12-15 minutes</b>. You may either: 
										<ul>
											<li>present your paper live during class, or</li>
											<li>play a recorded version during class.</li>
										</ul>
										In either case, <i>you must be present in-class to facilitate discussion</i>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Some questions that will be valuable to think about include: 
										<ul>
											<li>What is the motivation for the problem that the paper addresses?</li>
											<li>What methodology or approach did the researchers use?</li> 
											<li>What was the result or contribution?</li>
											<li>How was it evaluated?</li>
										</ul>
										In addition, think about how this paper fits in the context of the other course content we have covered. How does it relate to other topics we have discussed? <b>End your presentation with a question or two to spark discussion about the topic.</b>
									</p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3>Critique</h3>
									<p>
										In addition to describing the content of the paper, your presentation should also include some portion dedicated to your critique of the research. Some questions you can think about: 
										<ul>
											<li>What was done well?</li> 
											<li>What could have been improved?</li>
											<li>Do you have any critique of the methodology?</li> 
											<li>Was the analysis sound?</li> 
											<li>Did the evaluation match the claims the authors made?</li>
											<li>Did the authors appropriately contextualize their findings or overly generalize?</li> 
											<li>What would be a reasonable next step if you were to expand on this idea?</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3>For Everyone Else...</h3>
									<p>
										Think about the research that is presented to you. What questions are you left with? What did you think? What was done well? Peer feedback is a critical part of this class. Engage in the discussion around the research <i>as well as</i> your classmate's presentation. 
									</p>

									<!--Tips: Watch some of the videos that summarize papers here (2019 VIS previews) for inspiration. Keep in mind that these are mostly 3-5 minute videos. Your presentation in class should include greater detail. Use the aforementioned videos for inspiration; however, your presentation should not involve you playing back the video. Feel free to include graphs or figures from the paper to support your explanation.-->

									<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
									<ul>
									  <li><strong>In-Class Presentation:</strong> The date will be variable based on when you sign up. Your classmate will critique your work (using the <em>I like, I wish, What if</em> framework).</li>
									  <li><strong>Grading:</strong> Grading will be based on 
									  	<ul>
									  		<li>[10%] problem motivation,</li> 
									  		<li>[10%] methodology,</li>
									  		<li>[10%] contributions,</li>
									  		<li>[15%] connection to course content,</li>
									  		<li>[20%] discussion questions,</li>
									  		<li>[15%] presentation visuals,</li>
									  		<li>[10%] presentation clarity, and</li>
									  		<li>[10%] peer feedback.</li>
									  	</ul>

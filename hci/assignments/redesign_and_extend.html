									<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
									<p>In this project, we will be revisiting one of the previous group projects. That means you will be working again with a previous project group. Which project we revisit will be determined by students voting in a <a href="https://forms.gle/LMCoUfyqxzwAcMNb9">survey</a>. This page will be updated once the votes are in. This project will involve a few components. 
									</p>

									<h3 id="evaluate">Evaluate</h3>
									<p>You should begin by evaluating your previous design. You will first need to decide what your evaluation criteria are: what is important to assess about your design (learnability, accessibility, utility, ...)? How can you operationalize the measurement of this criteria? Revisit our lecture resources for evaluation methodologies (cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, usability study, etc) and decide if one of these is fitting for your evaluation goals. A good framework for thinking about this can be found in <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/interactions-16.pdf"><i>Research Contributions in Human-Computer Interaction</i></a> by Jacob Wobbrock and Julie Kientz. 
									</p> 

									<p>Your evaluation likely involves human subjects. Feel free to reach out to friends and classmates or other potential users of your target audience. That means you should <i>make yourself available to your classmates</i> to participate in their evaluations. You will likely need them to participate in yours as well. Some of this can be achieved during our hack day. Some of it will likely need to take place outside of class. 
									</p>

									<p>Of course, given the short time period of our design sprints, you may not be able to execute the ideal evaluation of your prototype. That's ok! Plan accordingly. If practical limitations prevent you from completing your group's ideal evaluation, be sure to reflect on that in your blog post. 
									</p>

									<p><strong>When in doubt, run your evaluation ideas by me.</strong></p>


									<h3 id="iterate">Iterate</h3>
									<p>Next, reflect deeply on your evaluation results. How can you use what you learned to inform the next iteration of your design? You will want to describe this reflection in your blog post and go on to implement these changes in your design.
									</p>


									<h3 id="extend">Extend</h3>
									<p>In the final part of this project, you will be expanding on your previous design using a new prototying modality: physical prototyping. You can find some examples <a href="https://stephaniebaione.com/work/physical-prototyping">here</a>.</p>

									<p>How you choose to extend your previous project can take many forms, entirely up to your group. Be sure to clearly state your goals. Depending on which project you are extending, some examples you might consider are redesigning the kiosk experience for MARTA, an accessible <a href="http://yvonnejansen.me/dataphys">data physicalization</a> experience, a wearable device to promote physical or mental wellbeing, etc. You should show evidence of iteration in your physical prototying as well. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/the-skeptics-guide-to-low-fidelity-prototyping/">Check out this article on low-fidelity prototyping for guidance.</a></p>


									<h5 id="tools">Tools</h5>
									<p>For this project, you will have access to tools and materials through <a href="https://hatchery.emory.edu">The Hatchery</a> at Emory (located at 1578 Avenue Place, Suite 200). You may also choose to use materials you find at home around the house (cardboard, plastic bottles, old tshirts, etc).</p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
									<ul>
									  <li>As always: Your design reflection as a Medium blog post. <strong>You will NOT need a demo video</strong>.</li>
									  <li>Your site should be publicly accessible so that others can visit it. <strong>Include this link in your design doc.</strong></li>
									  <li>Post the link of each Medium post along with your name on our Slack channel for Assignment 6 <b>and</b> submit the link on Canvas.</li>
									</ul>

					<h1>Tips for Working Successfully in Groups</h1>

					<p>
						<h3>Meet people properly</h3>
						It all starts with the introduction. Then, exchange contact
						information, and make sure you know how to pronounce everyone’s names. Exchange phone
						#s, and find out what hours are acceptable to call during.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Find things you have in common</h3>
						You can almost always find something in common with
						another person, and starting from that baseline, it’s much easier to then address
						issues where you have differences. This is why cities like professional sports teams,
						which are socially galvanizing forces that cut across boundaries of race and wealth. If
						nothing else, you probably have in common things like the weather.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Make meeting conditions good</h3>
						Have a large surface to write on, make sure the room
						is quiet and warm enough, and that there aren’t lots of distractions. Make sure no
						one is hungry, cold, or tired. Meet over a meal if you can; food <i><b>softens</b></i> a
						meeting. That’s why they "do lunch" in Hollywood.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Let everyone talk</h3> 
						Even if you think what they’re saying is stupid. Cutting
						someone off is rude, and not worth whatever small time gain you might make. Don’t
						finish someone’s sentences for him or her; they can do it for themselves. And
						remember: talking louder or faster doesn’t make your idea any better.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Check your egos at the door</h3>
						When you discuss ideas, immediately label them and
						write them down. The labels should be descriptive of the idea, not the originator:
						"the troll bridge story," not "Jane’s story."
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Praise each other</h3>
						Find something nice to say, even if it’s a stretch. Even
						the worst of ideas has a silver lining inside it, if you just look hard enough. Focus on
						the good, praise it, and then raise any objections or concerns you have about the rest of
						it. 
					</p>
					

					<p>
						<h3>Put it in writing</h3> 
						Always write down who is responsible for what, by when. Be <i><b>concrete</b></i>.
						Arrange meetings by email, and establish accountability. Never assume that someone’s
						roommate will deliver a phone message. Also, remember that "politics is when you have
						more than 2 people" – with that in mind, always CC (carbon copy) any piece of
						email within the group, or to me, to <u><b>all members</b></u> of the group. This rule
						should <i><b>never</b></i> be violated; don’t try to guess what your group mates
						might or might not want to hear about.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Be open and honest</h3>
						Talk with your group members if there’s a problem, and
						talk with me if you think you need help. The whole point of this course is that it’s
						tough to work across cultures. If we all go into it knowing that’s an issue, we
						should be comfortable discussing problems when they arise -- after all, that’s what
						this course is really about. Be forgiving when people make mistakes, but don’t be
						afraid to raise the issues when they come up.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Avoid conflict at all costs</h3>
						When stress occurs and tempers flare, take a short
						break. Clear your heads, apologize, and take another stab at it. Apologize for upsetting
						your peers, even if you think someone else was primarily at fault; the goal is to work
						together, not start a legal battle over whose transgressions were worse. It takes two to
						have an argument, so be the peacemaker.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Phrase alternatives as questions</h3>
						Instead of "I think we should do A, not
						B," try "What if we did A, instead of B?" That allows people to offer
						comments, rather than defend one choice.
					</p>

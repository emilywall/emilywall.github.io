									<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

									<p>
										There will be two types of quizzes throughout the semester: online short quizzes and in-class programming quizzes. 
									</p>

									<hr class="minor" />


									<h3 id="online">Online Quizzes</h2>

									<p>
										Expect a 15-minute online quiz (on Canvas), on an approximately weekly basis (generally on Thursdays). Exact details will be determined and announced in advance for each quiz.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Quiz grading policy</b>:  At the end of the semester, we will drop the lowest online quiz score you received in this course, and will use the rest of the quizzes to compute your short quizzes grade.
									</p>

									<hr class="minor" />


									<h3 id="programming">In-Class Programming Quizzes</h2>

									<p>
										We will also have several coding quizzes administered during class time. This will be your opportunity to demonstrate and prove your programming skills and knowledge!
									</p>
									<p>
										Exact dates & topics for these quizzes will be announced. Students who are not present in class during the quiz will receive a grade of zero for that quiz.  During the quiz, use of outside resources, use of phones, communication between students, and use of any other program or web site is prohibited and will be immediately reported to Emory's Honor Council.  These quizzes will be accessed on the JQuiz system. <span class="todo">Reconsider JQuiz?</span>
									</p>
									<p>
										Quizzes are to be taken on your own personal computer, which you must bring with you to class on days when a quiz is scheduled. If you anticipate not being able to bring your computer to class, please contact your instructor at least one week in advance, and we will find an alternative solution. If you do not have your computer on the day of a quiz and have not already made alternative plans with your instructor, you will receive a grade of zero for that quiz :-(

										<b>Quiz grading policy</b>:  At the end of the semester, we will drop the lowest in-class quiz score you received in this course, and will use the rest of the quizzes to compute your in-class programming quizzes grade.

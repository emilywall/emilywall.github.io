											<p><span class="icon solid fa-tools"></span> Choose one of the provided datasets, and design and implement an interactive visualization using either Tableau or Vega-Lite, depending on the skills and interest of your group (there is no correct or preferred choice between the two options -- choose whatever your group is comfortable with).</p>

											<p>Datasets: [to-do: link to dataset options; dataset options should include some analytic model component & should have some social relevance]</p>

											<p>Prepare a 15-minute presentation about your visual analytic solution. Which dataset did you choose? Who is your target audience? What are the analysis and / or communication goals of your solution? What design choices did you make along the way? Your grade will be based on the creativity, complexity, and execution of your design.</p>

										<h3 id="presentation">In-Class Presentation</h3>
									</header>
											<p><span class="icon solid fa-book"></span> What does research in information visualization look like? For this assignment, you'll sign up for a short in-class presentation on a paper of your choice from <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/welcome">IEEE VIS</a>.</p> 

											<p><b>Part 1 (All):</b> Create a slide deck to summarize a research paper in <i>10-12 minutes</i>. You will present your slide deck in class. Some questions that will be valuable to think about include: What is the motivation for the problem that the paper addresses? What methodology or approach did the researchers use? What was the result or contribution? In addition, think about how this paper fits in the context of the other course content we have covered. How does it relate to other topics we have discussed? Try to end your presentation with a question or two to spark discussion about the topic.</p>

											<p><b>Part 2 (Graduate Students):</b> In addition to describing the content of the paper, take an additional <i>3-5 minutes</i> and describe your critique of the research presented. What was done well? What could have been improved? Do you have any critique of the methodology? Was the analysis sound? Did the authors appropriately contextualize their findings or overly generalize? What would be a reasonable next step if you were to expand on this idea?</p>

											<p><b>For everyone else</b>, think about the research that is presented to you. What questions are you left with? What did you think? What was done well? Let's discuss!</p>

											<p><b>Tips:</b> Watch some of the videos that summarize papers <a href="https://vimeo.com/vgtcommunity">here (2019 VIS previews)</a> for inspiration. Keep in mind that these are mostly 3-5 minute videos. Your presentation in class should include greater detail. Use the aforementioned videos for inspiration; however, your presentation should not involve you playing back the video. Feel free to include graphs or figures from the paper to support your explanation.</p>

											<p><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CMZx48Lzsd1gUuYfAQtBgWIsviPdo2_vC5ZWZHTVd1Q/edit?usp=sharing">Sign up here</a></b> for the date you'd like to present. <i>Note: You must get approval for your chosen paper -- see me after class or <a href="mailto:emily.wall@emory.edu">email me</a></i>.</p>

										<h3 id="participation">Participation (10%)</h3>
									</header>
											<p>Data visualization is driven by both <i>theory</i> and <i>design</i>. As a result, some aspects are objective, while others are aesthetic (and thus somewhat subjective). Participating and engaging with the course content is important to develop both objective and subjective skillsets. Participation will involve a two components: </p>

											<p><span class="icon solid fa-brain"></span> <b>Quizzes (5%):</b> There will be several quizzes in-class throughout the semester. Each quiz will be one question, based on a concept from the lecture. <i>Don't panic</i> -- these are not intended to be trick questions. Each quiz is graded on a two-point scale: 1 point for attendance, 1 point for the correct answer.</p>

											<p><span class="icon solid fa-comment"></span> <b>In-Class Exercises & Online Discussions (5%):</b> Throughout the semester, there will be a number of in-class exercises, including design activities, discussions, etc. Some of these will involve turning in an artifact (e.g., a sketch) at the end of class. Part of your Participation grade will depend on turning something in. In addition, some discussions will take place online via Canvas. Ask and answer questions to help your classmates, give feedback on posted content, etc. Don't worry, there will be plenty of content to engage with (some exercises will be posted for discussion online rather than in-class). This component of your Participation grade will depend on once weekly engagement online.</p>

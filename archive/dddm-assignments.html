												<p>Design a static visualization for the given dataset (sketch on paper or use a digital design tool, such as PowerPoint / Keynote). The purpose of this assignment is to provide you with practice and experience designing the appearance of data tables and graphs. Below are two Excel spreadsheets. For the first, you should create a table that presents its information as clearly and informatively as possible. For the second, design a graph that does the same. Think about the data in each spreadsheet and what an analyst looking at that data would care about. You are allowed to derive new variables (attributes) that are combinations of the given ones, but you cannot make up totally new variables and values. <a href="media/course_materials/a2-DeptYearlyPerf.xls" download>Dataset 1: Performance of different company departments over year</a>; <a href="media/course_materials/a2-SalesRepPerf.xls" download>Dataset 2: Performance of sales representatives</a></p>

											<h5 id="hw4">HW2 <span class="icon solid fa-brain"></span></h5>
												<p>Take home quiz. This quiz will assess your understanding of driving principles of data-driven decision making. The quiz will be provided in-class the day before it's due. Open notes.</p>
												
											<h5 id="hw5">HW3 <span class="icon solid fa-brain"></span>,<span class="icon solid fa-signal"></span></h5>
												<p>Present a short critique of the given visualization. <i>This assignment will be completed in-class</i>. Consider the following questions to help guide your critique: What does the visualization do well? What could be improved? E.g., Are the choices of visual encoding appropriate? Does the visualization have strength or weakness w.r.t. accuracy, learnability, memorability, etc.? How might someone mis-read, mis-interpret, or mis-use this visualization? A good critique will describe what a visualization does well and what it does poorly, with integration of relevant perceptual, cognitive and social concepts to back up each claim.</p>

										<h3 id="group">Group Project</h3>

											<p><span class="icon solid fa-tools"></span> Choose one of the provided datasets, and design and implement an interactive visualization using either Tableau or Vega-Lite, depending on the skills and interest of your group (there is no correct or preferred choice between the two options -- choose whatever your group is comfortable with).</p>

											<p>Datasets: [to-do: link to dataset options; dataset options should include some analytic model component & should have some social relevance]</p>

											<p>Prepare a 15-minute presentation about your visual analytic solution. Which dataset did you choose? Who is your target audience? What are the analysis and / or communication goals of your solution? What design choices did you make along the way? Your grade will be based on the creativity, complexity, and execution of your design.</p>

										<h3 id="presentation">In-Class Presentation</h3>
									</header>
											<p><span class="icon solid fa-book"></span> Sign up for a short in-class presentation of a paper of your choice from <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/welcome">IEEE VIS</a>. Summarize in <b>10-12 minutes</b>: (1) the problem that the paper addresses, (2) the methodology, (3) the results, and (4) your discussion questions. </p>

											<p>For (4), stimulate discussion among the class. E.g., do you have any critique of the methodology? Was the analysis sound? Did the authors appropriately contextualize their findings or overly generalize?</p>

											<p>Watch some of the videos that summarize papers <a href="https://vimeo.com/vgtcommunity">here (2019 VIS previews)</a> for inspiration. Keep in mind that these are mostly 3-5 minute videos. Your presentation in class should likely include greater detail. Feel free to include graphs or figures from the paper. Use the aforementioned videos for inspiration; however, your presentation should not involve you playing back the video.</p>

											<p><i>Note: You must get approval for your chosen paper -- see me after class or <a href="mailto:emily.wall@emory.edu">email me</a></i>.</p>

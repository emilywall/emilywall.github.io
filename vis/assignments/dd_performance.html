									<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
									
									<p>
										The goal by the end of the semester is for us, as a class, to collectively brainstorm, define, and create a performance art piece. The performance art piece should be data-driven (conveying real-world data) on a topic of societal importance. This will be decomposed into several milestones throughout the semester. 
									</p>

									<p>
										For this assignment, it is imperative that you participate, communicate, and remain accountable to your classmates. We have an opportunity to do something new, different, and impactful. This only works if we all work together. Therefore, a large part of your grade at each milestone for this project will be based on peer evaluation. 
									</p>


									<hr class="minor" />


									<h3 id="define">What is Data-Driven Performance Art?</h3>

									<p>
										<b>Definition</b>: You won’t find much info on the web about data-driven performance art. Believe me, I tried. <i>(But actually, if you do… please share it!)</i> Data-driven performance art is a term we are coining this semester to refer to (you guessed it) performance art that is grounded in, shaped by, and representing data. In the context of the semester, our overarching motivation is <b>social justice</b>. That may mean that the data we work with can relate to social justice (health inequity, police brutality, …). That also means that the goal of our performance will be related to social justice -- to inform, to connect, to inspire, to change. 
									</p>

									<p>
										What kind of performance? Think movement. Think storytelling. Think marching band. These are just initial ideas -- we can collectively define the concept together this semester..
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Social Justice Context</b>: As a starting point, let's consider a dire local concern -- the recent movement around <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/atlantas-cop-city-people-protesting/story?id=96716095">Cop City</a> and activism against it such as <a href="https://stopcop.city">#StopCopCity</a>. In short, Cop City is a 381-acre plot of Weelaunee Forest leased to Atlanta Police Department intended to be developed into a police training facility. The #StopCopCity movement focuses on a slew of social justice concerns, including environmental deforestation, police militarization, theft of Moscogee land, and the opportunity cost of other critical uses of funding such as <a href="https://defendtheatlantaforest.org/2022/06/06/emory-doctors-condemn-cop-city-call-to-fund-public-health-initiatives-instead/">public health</a>. I suggest Cop City, as it is locally relevant and introduces a wide range of social justice concerns; however, you may choose to propose a different topic if you wish. This is an opportunity to use your creative and technological skills to make a difference! For our course project, we will ultimately need to converge on a single topic.

									<h3 id="teams">Teams</h3>

									<p>
										Everyone in the class will be involved in this project. One collective class-wide group project. That can be a mammoth task to coordinate and plan, so to make it achievable, we will organize ourselves into -teams responsible for different parts of the projects. The roles will include the following.  
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Creative Directors</b>: As a creative director, you would be one of a few students collectively overseeing the overall project direction. Your responsibilities would include scouting the filming location, tracking the progress of the project with the sub teams, and shaping the overall vision and direction of the project. Your workload would be spread throughout the semester, but heaviest at the end of the semester. 
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Dataset Curators</b>: As a dataset curator, you would be one of a handful of students responsible for identifying or collecting possible datasets to use in our project, cleaning the datasets (to manage outliers, missing data, etc), and potentially merging it into a useful form with other relevant datasets (e.g., combining a dataset on police shootings with demographic neighborhood data). Your workload would be spread throughout the semester, but heaviest early on. 
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Static Frame Designers</b>: As a static frame designer, you would be one of a handful of students responsible for interfacing with the dataset curators and creative directors to design static frames of our performance. This will include thinking through how the performers will encode data using space, color, movement, etc. Your workload would be spread throughout the semester, but heaviest in the middle.
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Narrators</b>: As a narrator, you would be one of a handful of students responsible for writing a script to tell a compelling story about the dataset produced by the data curators. You would work hand-in-hand with the static frame designers to coordinate the spoken story with the visuals. You would also be responsible for identifying other relevant forms of audio including sound tracks or sound effects that would be relevant to convey the story. Your workload would be spread throughout the semester, but heaviest in the middle.
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Choreographers</b>: As a choreographer, you would be one of a handful of students responsible for interfacing with the static frame designers and creative directors to plan out who moves where and how. Choreographers will likewise be responsible for planning costume. Your workload would be spread throughout the semester, but heaviest in the middle. 
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Videographers</b>: As a videographer, you would be one of a handful of students responsible for recording the final performance. This may involve using handheld video recorders or operating drones or other devices to obtain multiple perspectives of the performance. Your workload would be spread throughout the semester, but heaviest at the end. 
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Video Editors</b>: As a video editor, you would be one of a handful of students coordinating with the videographers, narrators, and directors to compile and edit the constituent components to produce the final vision of the project. You may also identify found footage to incorporate and design visual effects and annotations. Your workload would be spread throughout the semester, but heaviest at the end.  
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Performers</b>: As a performer, you would be responsible for showing up and being involved in the final filming of the project. Note that <b><u>most people in the class will fall under this role + one other</u></b>. Your workload would be spread throughout the semester, but heaviest at the end. 
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>**</b><i>If you have concerns about your contribution, please let me know as soon as possible.</i>
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>**NOTE</b>: You are encouraged to interface with the other teams at each and every milestone. Make sure they have what they need from you and that you have what you need from them.

									  <li><strong>Who:</strong> <span class="icon solid fa-user"></span> Individual</li>
									  <li><strong>Deadline:</strong> September 6, 2023</li>
									</ul>

									<p>
										In this survey, you will indicate your skillsets and interest in each of the above roles. You will also indicate your availability for a date in November that we may meet, if needed, to film our final performance. We will try, if possible, to film during class, but we will likely need to meet on at least one Saturday. Your attendance for this will be critical, so we ask that you please make yourself available on these days if possible. If we have to meet outside of class, we will provide snacks and likely cancel class before or after accordingly. Also note that when the workload for each group is heaviest will vary, so you may want to consider that in selecting your preferences.

									  <li><strong>Deadline:</strong> September 18, 2023</li>
									</ul>

									<p>
										Before we decide on the direction of the project, you will self-organize into groups of 3-4 students to pitch a project. We will use this as an opportunity to collectively brainstorm. 
									</p>

									<p>
										Your group will choose a general idea for a dataset, keeping in mind our ultimate goals of incorporating arts and social justice. You may have multiple ideas for this. That’s ok during the brainstorming phase, but you will need to reach a consensus for your final submission. Note that you do not need to actually find the data at this stage… just focus on your creativity around the ideas for this assignment!
									</p>

									<p>
										Next, <b>brainstorm!</b> Your group mates should independently sketch a minimum of three different ideas (they need not all be the same dataset… you may entertain the idea of multiple datasets initially, then narrow it down). Next, narrow it down! Sketch out what you envision a performance of that data might look like. 
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Reach a consensus.</b> Put your sketches down, discuss so your group mates understand each of the options, then reach a consensus. One option is to use a voting strategy: after pitching all of the ideas within your group, each member can place three votes on their favorite ideas (e.g., by adding a sticky note onto the sketch). 
									</p>

									<p>
										After reaching this consensus, you may have ideas on how to refine the idea together as a group. You should produce one final (more polished) sketch of your final idea. Clean it up using pen, colored pencils, or digital sketch tools. 
									</p>

									<p>
										You will <b>present your idea to the class</b>, as a short video or a slide show, so that we may use these ideas to collectively decide on our project direction. 
									</p>


									<p>
										<b>Submission:</b> Via Canvas.
										<ul>
											<li>Brainstorming: Each group member should independently sketch a minimum of three different ideas. How would you encode the variables of the data using visual cues, sound, or movement? These need not be high fidelity sketches, but we should be able to tell what’s going on. Be sure that each sketch has 1. The name of the person who completed the sketch, 2. The sketch itself, 3. A brief bulleted list describing the dataset you are representing, and 4. A brief description/annotation of the relevant encodings, to ensure that we can tell what’s going on in your sketch.</li>
											<li>Dataset description: 1 paragraph describing the final dataset your group has chosen. Remember that you need not have located a dataset just yet. Why does your team care about this dataset? Is this data that likely already exists or may need to be collected? How is it relevant to social justice?</li>
											<li>Final sketch: Your final sketch will be graded based on how complete, compelling, creative, and polished your idea is.</li>
											<li>In-Class Presentation: In no more than 5 minutes, sell your group’s idea to the class. What data did your group choose to focus on? How do you envision performance of that data? What do you hope the outcome would be from the performance?</li>
											<li>Peer Evaluation: You will <a href="https://forms.gle/3ntPgB5kctPq9c5V7">complete a survey</a> giving honest feedback on the contributions of your teammates.</li>

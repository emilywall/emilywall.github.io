									<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
									<p><span class="icon solid fa-book"></span> What does research in information visualization look like? For this assignment, you'll sign up for a short virtual presentation on a paper of your choice from <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/welcome">IEEE VIS</a>.</p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3 id="part1">Part 1 (All)</h3>

									<p>Create a slide deck to summarize a research paper in <i>10-12 minutes</i>. You will submit a recording of your presentation on <a href="https://piazza.com/emory/fall2021/cs485cs584/home">Piazza</a>, where your classmates can respond and discuss. Some questions that will be valuable to think about include: What is the motivation for the problem that the paper addresses? What methodology or approach did the researchers use? What was the result or contribution? In addition, think about how this paper fits in the context of the other course content we have covered. How does it relate to other topics we have discussed? <b>End your presentation with a question or two to spark discussion on Piazza about the topic.</b></p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3 id="part2">Part 2 (Graduate Students Only)</h3>

									<p>In addition to describing the content of the paper, take an additional <i>2-3 minutes</i> and describe your critique of the research presented. What was done well? What could have been improved? Do you have any critique of the methodology? Was the analysis sound? Did the authors appropriately contextualize their findings or overly generalize? What would be a reasonable next step if you were to expand on this idea?</p>

									<p><b>For everyone else</b>, think about the research that is presented to you. What questions are you left with? What did you think? What was done well? Respond to your classmates' posts with your impressions throughout the semester (<i>respond to at least one post per week</i>). In addition to participating in discussion on Piazza, part of your grade will be based on providing <a href="https://forms.gle/8jMzsp7KU7ZdkkGm9">peer feedback</a> <i>to each other student</i>.</p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3> 

									<p>Watch some of the videos that summarize papers <a href="https://vimeo.com/vgtcommunity">here (2019 VIS previews)</a> for inspiration. Keep in mind that these are mostly 3-5 minute videos. Your presentation in class should include greater detail. Use the aforementioned videos for inspiration; however, your presentation should not involve you playing back the video. Feel free to include graphs or figures from the paper to support your explanation.</p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3 id="schedule">Presentation Schedule</h3> 

									<p><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CMZx48Lzsd1gUuYfAQtBgWIsviPdo2_vC5ZWZHTVd1Q/edit?usp=sharing">View the schedule of presentations here</a></b>. The schedule will be populated based on balancing your preferences in the course survey you will complete on Day 1. <i>Note: You must get approval for your chosen paper -- see me after class or <a href="mailto:emily.wall@emory.edu?Subject=CS485/584%20Research%20Presentation">email me</a></i>.</p>

									<hr class="minor" />

									<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3> 

									<p>Grading will be based on [10%] problem motivation, [10%] methodology, [10%] contributions, [15%] connection to course content, [20%] discussion questions, [15%] presentation visuals, [10%] presentation clarity, and [10%] <a href="https://forms.gle/8jMzsp7KU7ZdkkGm9">peer feedback</a>.</p>
